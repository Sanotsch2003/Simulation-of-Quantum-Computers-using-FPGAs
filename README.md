# Simulation of Quantum Computers using FPGAs
 
In this project, I am designing a processor capable of simulating quantum computers. To achieve this, I am designing all components of the processor using the hardware description language VHDL and optimizing them with the goal of simulating quantum algorithms efficiently and with low runtime. With the processor architecture I have designed, I am able to calculate and output the state vector of a quantum computer with 14 qubits. For this purpose, I am using a command set created by me, which allows me to apply H, T, and CNOT operations to arbitrary qubits, representing a universal gate set in quantum computers. I have tested my processor both in simulation and in practice on the Basys3â„¢ FPGA Board from Digilent, achieving the desired results in both cases. Although the runtime in the current version is still below that of a modern desktop processor, the energy efficiency is already at a similar level. Various optimization approaches and the scalability of my architecture offer promising possibilities for further improvement in the future.
