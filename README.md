# Simulation of Quantum Computers using FPGAs
 
This project aims to create a hardware architecture that can efficiently simulate quantum computers. For development, the hardware description language VHDL is used. So far, the architecture has been tested on the Basys3™ FPGA Board by Digilent. Although the runtime in the current version is still below that of a modern desktop processor, the energy efficiency is already at a similar level. Due to the quite limited BRAM capacity of the Basys3™ board, the maximum number of qubits that can be simulated is 14. The serial interface, used to program the FPGA and receive the calculated state vector, is the biggest limitation of this project due to its small bandwidth. In future versions, these problems will hopefully be solved by using different interfaces for communication and external storage devices. Along with the VHDL code used to develop the hardware architecture, this repository contains Python code for interfacing with the FPGA (including a compiler) as well as different software approaches to simulating quantum computers (a custom simulation written in Python and a simulation powered by Qiskit).
